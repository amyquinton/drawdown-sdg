*By [Amy Quinton][7] and [Daniel Newman][8]*

[The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)][1] are global development targets adopted in September 2015, set to be achieved by 2030, by all [United Nations Member States][4]. All countries have agreed to work towards achieving these goals. Underneath the 17 goals are [169 SDG targets][5] and [232 unique indicators][6] to measure progress on the goals.

[Climate Action is number 13][9] of these [17 SDGs][1] that the world has agreed is of critical importance. 

A separate initiative, [Project Drawdown][2], has identified a range of solutions ("drawdown solutions"), ranked via objective measures of CO2-equivalent reduction and net-costs, that if implemented will go a long way to achieving the Climate Action SDG. 

*We realised that many of these [drawdown solutions][3] also provide additional sustainable development benefits, related directly to many of the other [17 SDGs][1].* So we attempted to categorise which of [Project Drawdown's top 76  solutions][3] we thought related to which of the [17 SDGs][1]. The figure and table below shows our rudimentary assessment that the [Project Drawdown's solutions][3] make a positive contribution to 16 of the [17 SDGs][1], not just to the Climate Action SDG!
