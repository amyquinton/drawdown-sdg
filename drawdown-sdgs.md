[The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)][1] are global development targets adopted in September 2015, set to be achieved by 2030, by all [United Nations Member States][4]. All countries have agreed to work towards achieving these goals. Underneath the 17 goals are [169 SDG targets][5] and [232 unique indicators][6] to measure progress on the goals.
